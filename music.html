      <p>A limited number of my songs are available on streaming services. The rest are only available on <a href="https://catet0nal.bandcamp.com"><b>Bandcamp</b></a> (purchase) or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CATET0NAL">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCtilDokxLIg8QlSXvot4VNQ">YouTube Music</a> (streaming). Additionally, I don't care if you use my music in a project of any kind - as long as the usage is non-commercial and you give credit, feel free to use my songs however you want!</p>

      <p>After making one song in 2014 I sat on it for a year before cranking out two more in 2015. This kickstarted the <b>Chip Party</b> project, which ended in 2016 when I decided to ditch chiptune to experiment with other things.</p>

      <p><br>2017 was the year of <b>P.I.A.N.O.</b>, a set of three volumes consisting of entirely solo piano music.</p>
      <p><b>Powder (P.I.A.N.O.: Vol 2):</b></p>

      <p><br>In 2018 I released a remastered collection of the entire P.I.A.N.O. library plus an EP called <b>VI</b> alongside four previously unreleased tracks titled <b>R.E.P.I.A.N.O.M.I.X</b> (a staggering 32 songs!).</p>

      <p><br>2019 was the 10 year anniversary of my YouTube channel, so I released a special EP called <b>Odyssey</b> to commemorate the occasion.</p>

      <p><br>2020 was the year of more experimentation, breaking from the piano chains to start adding more instruments. This resulted in <b>sys(FAIL</b> and <b>oscillations</b>, two very unique EP's that would lay out the groundwork for how my music would sound going forward.</p>

      <p><br>After all the time put into the aforementioned EPs I wanted to create a "best of" album that would reflect the range of music I've made. This became <b>TemApex</b>, though I just call it the blue album. Released in 2021, it doesn't contain motifs unlike a lot of my older works and the production quality is a lot higher, so it's a good starting point if you're a new listener.</p>
      <p><b>System Failure (TemApex):</b></p>

      <p><br>After the blue album came <b>Keep On Going</b> - a single that I still hold as being one of my best works - and <b>Aftermath</b>, an EP made from the remnants of a cancelled album.</p>
      <p><b>Keep On Going (single):</b></p>

      <p><br>After Aftermath released at the start of 2022 it took a whole 3 years for me to finally release a new song. After the release of <b>Breaking & Entering</b> I officially put music on the backburner to focus on other things.</p>
      <p><b>Breaking & Entering (single):</b></p>

      <p><br>Given my history it might sound like I know what I'm doing, but truthfully I don't. I have had no musical training or education and just work off vibes alone, for better or worse.</p>
      <p><br>Some of my personal favourite songs are <b>System Failure</b>, <b>Breaking & Entering</b>, <b>Seasons</b>, <b>Powder</b>, and <b>Perfect Resolution</b>.</p>
