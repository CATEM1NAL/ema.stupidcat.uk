        <p>Hello! I'm <b>C@:\EM1NAL\</b>, otherwise known as <b>Ema</b> (previously known as <b>Ema Pex</b> (previously previously <b>TemApex</b> (previously previously previously <b>TemA</b>))). I've been around on the internet since 2009 when I uploaded my <a href="https://youtu.be/wtDMEBEzFhQ">first YouTube video</a>. Around 2016 I dropped my original channel to work on a group channel with some friends, however due to various disagreements on how the channel should be run I left in 2017. I've since operated independently and evolved in a number of ways... some definitely worse than others.</p>
