      <p>After making one song in 2014 I sat on it for a year before cranking out two more in 2015. This kickstarted the <b>Chip Party</b> project, which ended in 2016 when I decided to ditch chiptune to experiment with other things.</p>

      <p><br>2017 was the year of <b>P.I.A.N.O.</b>, a set of three volumes consisting of entirely solo piano music.</p>
      <p><b>Powder (P.I.A.N.O.: Vol 2):</b></p>

      <p><br>In 2018 I released a remastered collection of the entire P.I.A.N.O. library plus an EP called <b>VI</b> alongside four previously unreleased tracks titled <b>R.E.P.I.A.N.O.M.I.X</b> (a staggering 32 songs!).</p>

      <p><br>2020 was the year of more experimentation, breaking from the piano chains to start adding more instruments. This resulted in <b>sys(FAIL</b> and <b>oscillations</b>, two very unique EP's that would lay out the groundwork for how my music would sound going forward.</p>

      <p><br>After all the time put into the aforementioned EPs I wanted to create a "best of" album that would reflect the range of music I've made. This became <b>TemApex</b>, though I just call it the blue album. It doesn't contain motifs unlike a lot of my older works and the production quality is a lot higher, so it's a good starting point if you're a new listener.</p>
      <p><b>System Failure (TemApex):</b></p>

      <p><br>After the blue album came <b>Keep On Going</b> - a single that I still hold as being one of my best works - and <b>Aftermath</b>, an EP made from the remnants of a cancelled album.</p>
      <p><b>Keep On Going:</b></p>

      <p><br>Given my history it might sound like I know what I'm doing, but truthfully I don't. I have had no musical training or education and just work off vibes alone, for better or worse.</p>
      <p><br>Some of my personal favourite songs are <b>System Failure</b>, <b>Breaking & Entering</b>, <b>Seasons</b>, <b>Powder</b>, and <b>Perfect Resolution</b>.</p>
